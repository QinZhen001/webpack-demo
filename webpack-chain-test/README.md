## webpack-chain

webpack's core configuration is based on creating and modifying a potentially unwieldy JavaScript object. While this is OK for configurations on individual projects, trying to share these objects across projects and make subsequent modifications gets messy, as you need to have a deep understanding of the underlying object structure to make those changes.

webpack的核心配置基于创建和修改一个潜在的笨拙的JavaScript对象。虽然这对于单个项目的配置来说是可以的，但是尝试在项目之间共享这些对象并进行后续修改会变得很麻烦，因为您需要深入了解底层对象结构才能进行这些更改。

webpack-chain attempts to improve this process by providing a chainable or fluent API for creating and modifying webpack configurations. Key portions of the API can be referenced by user-specified names, which helps to standardize how to modify a configuration across projects.
